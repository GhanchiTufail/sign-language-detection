1. collectdata.py
Collect Data for Gesture Recognition
This script is used to collect image data for gesture recognition. It captures video frames from your webcam, allowing you to save images corresponding to different gestures as the user presses specific keys.

Features:
Capture video feed from your webcam.
Save frames in a specific folder structure based on gestures.
Press keys (a-z) to capture and save images for each gesture category.
The images are stored in separate folders for each letter (A-Z).
Requirements:
OpenCV (cv2)
Python 3.x
Usage:
Make sure your webcam is properly connected.
Run the script collectdata.py.
Press the keys a-z to capture images for corresponding gestures.
The images are saved in Image/ directory inside subfolders A, B, C, ..., Z.
Folder Structure:
Image/
A/
B/
C/
... (and so on for each letter A-Z)




2. trainmodel.py
Train Gesture Recognition Model
This script is used to train a gesture recognition model using data collected by collectdata.py. It uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for sequence classification.

Features:
Loads pre-collected gesture data stored in .npy format.
Prepares sequences and labels for training.
Utilizes a LSTM network with multiple layers to train on the gesture data.
Saves the trained model in both .json and .h5 formats.
Includes TensorBoard callback for logging during training.
Requirements:
TensorFlow (Keras)
scikit-learn
NumPy
Python 3.x
Model Architecture:
LSTM layers with 64 and 128 units.
Dense layers for output classification.
Folder Structure:
Logs/ - Contains logs for TensorBoard visualization.
How to Run:
Ensure that trainmodel.py is executed after collectdata.py and the required gesture data has been collected.
The model will be saved in model.json and model.h5.




3. function.py
Function Definitions for Gesture Recognition
This script contains helper functions required for processing gesture recognition data. It uses the mediapipe library to process images for hand or body gesture recognition.

Features:
Contains functions for processing video frames using mediapipe.
Detects gestures or hands from the webcam feed and prepares the data for training.
Requirements:
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Mediapipe
Python 3.x
How to Use:
This file is meant to be imported into other scripts like trainmodel.py for processing data.
Ensure that mediapipe is installed for gesture detection.






4. data.py
Data Preparation for Gesture Recognition
This script prepares and processes the gesture recognition dataset. It ensures that the data is formatted and ready for training the model in trainmodel.py.

Features:
Loads gesture data stored in .npy format.
Organizes data into sequences for training.
Maps labels for each gesture to numerical values.
Requirements:
NumPy
Python 3.x
How to Use:
This file is typically used to load the pre-processed data before training the model.
It is not meant to be executed independently but serves as an intermediary step.




5. app.py
Gesture Recognition Application
This script runs the actual gesture recognition application, where the trained model is used to classify gestures in real-time. It uses the webcam feed and the trained model to recognize gestures.

Features:
Captures webcam input and processes it for gesture recognition.
Loads the trained model and uses it to classify gestures.
Provides real-time feedback on the detected gesture.
Requirements:
OpenCV (cv2)
Keras/TensorFlow
Python 3.x
How to Run:
Make sure the trained model (model.json and model.h5) is available.
Run the app.py script to start real-time gesture recognition using the webcam.
